	<h3>What's new</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>We relaxed the yellow and red sentence highlighting. It should now be a little easier to get them to go away now.</li>
		<li>We fixed two issues that caused the text to double up.</li>
		<li>Printing was broken for some people. Fixed that too.</li>
		<li>It was a bit hard to get the cursor to appear when the document was empty. Fixed.</li>
		<li>Some 10-dollar-word replacement suggestions said "Replace with: omit." That was dumb. Now it just says "omit."</li>
		<li>The app no longer incorrectly tags some "-ly" words, like "grisly," as adverbs.</li>
	</ul>
